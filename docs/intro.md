## Fast Track ‚è±Ô∏è

Let's discover **Web app template in less than 5 minutes**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [NPM access token](./cli-tool.md) for DNV-Cli tool:
  - How to get the token? Click [Here](./cli-tool.md).

### Generate a new FE application

**CLI tool** will guide you to create a project after you run the command:

```bash
npx dnv-cli init
```

Follow the command guide, you will get dnv-cli installed and the template will be downloaded by your choose.

After template is downloaded, you could use command lines:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
cd project_name
npm install
npm run start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
cd project_name
yarn
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
cd project_name
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

to run your project.

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created project work, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` / `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
